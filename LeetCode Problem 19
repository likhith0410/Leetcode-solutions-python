LeetCode Problem 19: Remove Nth Node From End of List
Difficulty: Medium

🧠 Problem Statement:
Given the head of a singly linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

✅ Example:
Input:
head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2

Output:
[1,2,3,5]

✅ Approach:
Use the two-pointer technique (fast and slow pointers) along with a dummy node to simplify edge cases.

Steps:

-Use a dummy node pointing to head to handle cases like removing the head.
-Move fast pointer n + 1 steps ahead (including dummy).
-Move both fast and slow pointers until fast reaches the end.
-slow will now be just before the node to remove.
-Skip the target node: slow.next = slow.next.next.
This ensures a one-pass solution without needing to count the total length first.

code:python

class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
        # Create a dummy node to handle edge cases like removing the head
        dummy = ListNode(0, head)
        
        # Two pointers both starting at dummy
        slow = dummy
        fast = dummy

        # Move the fast pointer n + 1 steps ahead
        for _ in range(n + 1):
            fast = fast.next
        
        # Move both pointers until fast reaches the end
        while fast:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next

        # Skip the nth node from the end
        slow.next = slow.next.next

        # Return the new head (could be different if head was removed)
        return dummy.next


🔁 Dry Run:
Input: head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], n = 2
-dummy → [0 | *] → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
-After moving fast ahead by 3 steps: fast is at 3, slow is at dummy.
-Move both one by one → when fast hits None, slow is at node 3.
-Remove node 4: slow.next = slow.next.next

✅ Final List: 1 → 2 → 3 → 5

📊 Time Complexity:
O(n):
Traverse the entire list once.

🧠 Space Complexity:
O(1):
Only constant pointers (fast, slow, dummy) used.
