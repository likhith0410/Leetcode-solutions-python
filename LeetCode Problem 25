LeetCode Problem 25: Reverse Nodes in k-Group
Difficulty: Hard

🧠 Problem Statement:
Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.
k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list.
If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k, the remaining nodes should remain in the same order.

🔁 You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

✅ Example:
Input:
head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output:
[3,2,1,4,5]

✅ Approach:

-Use a dummy node to simplify edge case handling.
-Loop through the list in chunks of size k.
-For each k-sized group:
-Check if there are enough nodes left.
-Reverse the nodes in that group.
-Reconnect with the previous and next sections of the list.
